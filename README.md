## Documentation
### Introduction
The concept of the app is to be like the original Split-Wise but with a comand line interface and with less complex functionalities. After the server is started, clients can connect by booting up their client app.  
To see the full list of commands the user has to type "help". To be able to access all commands fully the user must be logged in his account. If he doesn't have one he can create one using the command "register".  
If you have used Splitwise before, all commands should seem intuitive.
